    <h1>Welcome to Our School SMP!</h1>
    <p>
      This is the official website for our School Minecraft SMP (Survival Multiplayer) server. Whether you’re a student on Bedrock or Java Edition, our SMP is the perfect place to play Minecraft with friends from school in a safe, fun, and creative environment. 🎮<br><br>

      The School SMP is a student-run project supported by our school community. It's more than just a server — it’s a place where creativity meets teamwork, where you can build your dream base, go on epic adventures, or collaborate with classmates to make amazing creations.<br><br>

      All players must follow server rules to keep the experience positive and respectful for everyone. New to the server? Make sure to read the <a href="rules.html">Rules & How to Join</a> page to learn how to get whitelisted and join the fun! We accept students using school emails that end in <strong>@ssdedu.org</strong> — make sure you’re using the correct email when signing up or contacting us.<br><br>

      We’ll also be hosting awesome events, like build competitions, scavenger hunts, and survival challenges. Stay tuned for updates!<br><br>

      Ready to get started? Use the navigation above to explore the site. You can learn more about the SMP, view the rules, download any needed files, contact the admins, or create an account.<br><br>

      Have fun, play fair, and build something epic! 🌍🧱🔥
