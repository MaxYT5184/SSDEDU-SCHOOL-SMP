    <h1>About Our School SMP</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the official SMP (Survival Multiplayer) server for our school community! üéì<br><br>
      Our SMP is a fun and safe place for students to play Minecraft together. The server is available for both **Minecraft Java and Bedrock editions**, so everyone can join regardless of the platform they‚Äôre using. Whether you like building, surviving, exploring, or collaborating with friends, this server is perfect for you.<br><br>

      The idea of the School SMP was started by students who wanted to build something fun outside of the classroom ‚Äî and now it's grown into a place where we can all hang out after school, work on epic builds, and enjoy survival gameplay together.<br><br>

      This SMP is strictly moderated and follows school-appropriate rules. Our goal is to make sure everyone has a good time, stays respectful, and builds awesome things in the Minecraft world. We also host **events, challenges, and building contests** every now and then, so stay tuned for updates!<br><br>

      To join the SMP, check out our <a href="rules.html">Rules & How to Join</a> page for the server IP and instructions.<br><br>

      For questions or issues, feel free to reach out to our admin team using your school email that starts with <strong>@ssdedu.org</strong>, or use the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page to send us a message. See you in the game! üß±üåç
